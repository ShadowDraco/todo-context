## Learning Outcomes

- Learn React context functionality and gain overall React fluency.
- Gain proficiency in reading documentation by using a new component library.
- Practice JavaScript array manipulation by implementing pagination.
- Gain React testing fluency.

## Phase 1 Requirements

In Phase 1, we're going to perform some refactoring of a Todo application built by another team.

- Properly modularize the application into separate components, note the **proposed** file structure below.
- Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components.
- Style the application using the [Mantine Component API](https://mantine.dev/pages/getting-started/)
